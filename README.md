# StateMachine
Unity State Machine Assignment 

Simple State Machine Implementation using State classes.

Enemy object changes colors based on:
- whether the player is visible or not (in this implementation its just a bool you can check/uncheck in the inspector to get the desired effect)
- if the enemy's health drops below 5 (also available for modification in inspector)

this is an example for the purpose of better understanding the pattern, so definitely nothing mind blowing but hopefully it helps give a clearer picture
